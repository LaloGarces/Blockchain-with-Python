# Blockchain-with-Python

## In this Colab notebook, the intention is to develop a simple Blockchain with Python, to understand how a Block is created, how a chain works and the importance of the hash within the Blockchain. 

##We're going to use Colab for the develpment of the code in Python and Postman to get some request we're going to send from Colab.
